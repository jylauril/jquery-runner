# runner: jQuery plugin

A simple runner/stopwatch jQuery plugin for counting time up and down.

### Project Status

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/jylauril/jquery-runner.png)](https://david-dm.org/jylauril/jquery-runner)  [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/jylauril/jquery-runner/dev-status.png)](https://david-dm.org/jylauril/jquery-runner#info=devDependencies)  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jylauril/jquery-runner.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jylauril/jquery-runner)

## Installation

Grab the latest version from the build/ folder.

There's several different versions of the file, but you only need one.

* In case you want to develop against the Runner, you can pick the non-minified version `jquery.runner.js`.
* If you want to deploy Runner with your site/app, pick either `jquery.runner-min.js`.
* Or if you develop with CoffeeScript and really want to know what's happening there, grab the `jquery.runner.coffee`. (Disclaimer: no support provided for the CoffeeScript file. If you don't know what it is, don't use it.)

Include script *after* the jQuery library:

```html
<script src="jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.runner.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```


## Usage

#### First you need a container element where we can input the value of the runner:

```html
<span id="runner"></span>
```

Note that this allows you to use any kind of element (h1, div, span, td, li, input, etc), and gives you an easy way to style it any way you want. Just remember that everything inside the container will be replaced with the formatted time.

#### Then you initialize the runner to that element:

```javascript
$('#runner').runner();
```

#### After that you can start the runner from a button click or some other event:

```javascript
$('#myButton').click(function() {
    $('#runner').runner('start');
});
```


**More examples below**

## Methods

By default, when the runner method is invoked, the script will initialize itself to the selected element. If no options are given, the default values are used.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner();
```



`start` - Start the runner. If runner is not already initialized, it will first initialize and then start itself. Fires `runnerStart` event.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('start');
```



`stop` - Stop the runner. Fires `runnerStop` event.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('stop');
```



`lap` - Take a lap time (time between the current time and time from the last checkpoint) and return it as a formatted string. Fires `runnerLap` event.

```javascript
alert("Current lap time: " + $('#runner').runner('lap'));
```



`toggle` - Toggle between `start` and `stop`.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('toggle');
```



`reset` - Resets the time and settings to the original (initial) values. Fires `runnerReset` event. **Note that if the runner is running when invoking this method, this does not stop the runner, it just resets the time back to where it started and continues from there.**

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('reset');
```

To stop the runner along with the reset, you can provide an additional boolean true parameter for the command.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('reset', true);
```



`version` - Returns the current version string of the runner plugin

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('version');
```



`info` - Returns a JavaScript object with information about the current status of the runner.

```javascript
$('#runner').runner('info');
```
The following methods can be called upon this object:
* `running` - Check if the runner is running.
* `finished` - Check if the runner has finished running.
* `time` - Returns amount of time elapsed, in milliseconds.
* `formattedTime` - Returns time elapsed as a formatted string.
* `startTime` - Returns absolute runner starting time.
* `lapTime` - Returns lap time.
* `formattedLaptime` - Returns lap time as a formatted string.

e.g:
```javascript
$('#runner').runner('info').formattedTime;
```

## Options

You can alter the behavior by passing options object to the initialization.

#### Here's a list of options you can use:

* `autostart` - (boolean) If set to true, the runner will be started automatically after the initialization. Defaults to false. If set to true, will trigger `runnerStart` event once the runner starts.

* `countdown` - (boolean) If set to true, the time will run down instead of up (default). **Note that if you set this to true, you should also set `startAt` option, otherwise the time goes to negative.**

* `startAt` - (integer) Time in milliseconds from which the runner should start running. Defaults to 0.

* `stopAt` - (integer) Time in milliseconds at which the runner should stop running and invoke the `runnerStop` and `runnerFinish` events. Default is null (don't stop). This works with both counting up and down, as long as the value is within the current run direction.

* `milliseconds` - (boolean) If set to false, the default formatter will omit the milliseconds from displaying. Defaults to true (show milliseconds). **Note that if you use a custom formatter, this option will not affect the first value of that custom formatter function. This property, however, is passed in the object as second argument.**

* `format` - (function) A custom format function to replace the default time formatting. By default this is not set. Takes in two arguments: first one is the current time value in milliseconds, second one is the settings object. This function should return a string or a number.


## Events

#### There are 5 events that gets fired:

* `runnerStart` - This event gets fired when the `start` method is invoked, or if `autostart` option is set to true. Basically when ever the runner starts (duh!).

* `runnerStop` - This event gets fired when the `stop` method is invoked. Note that this event is also fired when the runner reaches the `stopAt` value.

* `runnerLap` - This event gets fired when the `lap` method is invoked.

* `runnerReset` - This event gets fired when the `reset` method is invoked.

* `runnerFinish` - This event gets fired when the runner reaches the `stopAt` value.

Each of these events will pass the result of the `info` method as an argument in the event call. See examples for usage.

## Examples

#### Initialize a count down runner that starts from 60 seconds, and start it automatically:

```javascript
$('#runner').runner({
    autostart: true,
    countdown: true,
    startAt: 60000 // alternatively you could just write: 60*1000
});
```


#### Initialize a count up runner that stops after 2 minutes:

```javascript
$('#runner').runner({
    stopAt: 120000 // 2(min) * 60(sec) * 1000(ms) = 120000
});
```


#### Initialize a count down runner that starts from 30 seconds, updates the value once every second and doesn't show milliseconds:

```javascript
$('#runner').runner({
    countdown: true,
    startAt: 30000,
    milliseconds: false,
});
```


#### Initialize a normal count up runner with a custom formatter function that displays the time in minutes (with decimals):

```javascript
$('#runner').runner({
    format: function(value) {
        return (value / 1000) / 60;
    }
});
```

#### Initialize a count down runner that starts from 12 minutes and stops at 0, and alerts when the runner finishes:

```javascript
$('#runner').runner({
    countdown: true,
    startAt: 12 * 60 * 1000,
    stopAt: 0
}).on('runnerFinish', function(eventObject, info) {
    alert('The eggs are now hard-boiled!');
});
```

## Changelog

### v2.3.3 - *2014-08-06* - Small improvement
* Made the non-vendor specific requestAnimationFrame the primary one to suppress deprecation error messages.

* Runner now utilizes requestAnimationFrame if applicable and falls back to setTimeout

* Removed ability to tweak the runner interval due to requestAnimationFrame change

### v2.2.0 - *2013-05-24* - Feature improvements and fixes
* Fixed a couple of small underlying bugs
* The first lap-time value now takes under consideration if the startAt time was something else than 0
* Lap-time now returns negative value if we are counting down

### v2.1.3 - *2013-05-22* - Yet another bug fix release
* I make a lot of bugs apparently
* Runner lap wasn't returning the correct lap time, it's fixed now, I swear!

### v2.1.2 - *2013-03-22* - Bug fix release

* Added a way to stop the runner when calling `reset` method with a boolean true parameter.
* Runner now fires a `runnerFinish` event after it reaches the `stopAt` value.
* We now also fire a `runnerReset` event after the `reset` method is called.
* Streamlined the other events to be more consistent.
  * `runnerStarted` is now `runnerStart`.
  * `runnerStopped` is now `runnerStop`.
